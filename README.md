# Boardgame Values

This repo pulls data from BoardGameGeek.com and MiniatureMarket with the goal of developing some sort of valuation around board games.  

The valuation will then be able to determine if, for the user, whether the game will be worth buying at the current price.

The details and method of the valuation have yet to be determined.
